									<h2>Time line combing</h2>

									<p>
										The 2025 China-US trade war marks a significant escalation in the ongoing economic tensions between the world's two largest economies. 
										This round of conflict began early in the year, characterized by a rapid sequence of tariff increases and retaliations, reflecting deep-rooted strategic, economic, and geopolitical challenges.
									</p>
									<p>To gain an in-depth understanding of the trade war, we must first sort out the timeline of the trade war.</p>

									<p>The timeline reveals how quickly the trade conflict intensified. Within just a few months, tariffs escalated from initial modest increases to extraordinarily high cumulative rates.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>What were people's reactions?</h2>
									<p>To conduct an in-depth analysis of the international community's response to the China-US trade war in 2025, we systematically collected relevant reports from a number of global news websites and studied the relationship between the number of reports, changes in tariff rates and key events.</p>
									<p>In addition, through keyword extraction and sentiment categorization of the news reports, we further studied the types and percentage changes of the emotions presented in the reports at the corresponding time points.</p>
									
									<div id="tariff-chart1" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: auto;"></div>
									
									
									<p>
										It can be clearly observed from the graph that there are three main peaks in the number of news reports on the time axis, which are respectively concentrated around February 4th, around March 4th and around April 9th. 
										These time points all correspond to important events of phased significance in the trade war, and are also accompanied by significant adjustments in tariff policies.
									</p>
									<p>Next, we will analyze these three peaks of news reports respectively:</p>
									<h3>Peak1</h3>
									<p>
										The spike occurred around the time that the United States first announced a 10 percent tariff increase on Chinese products that went into effect, along with China's subsequent announcement of its first round of countermeasures. 
										As this was the first escalation of the trade war, the suddenness of the event and the immediacy of the policy impact sparked widespread attention. 
										However, it is worth noting that after this peak, the heat of the news discussion quickly receded, with the number of reports dropping in late February to the level before the trade war began. 
										This suggests that this round of conflict, while generating attention, did not spark a sustained ferment of international opinion in the initial phase. 
										It suggests that the media and public attention was more short-term and may have viewed the tax hike as a temporary game.
									</p>
									<h3>Peak2</h3>
									<p>
										The second peak occurred during the period when the United States announced another 10 per cent tariff increase and China quickly responded by raising taxes on United States agricultural products. 
										Compared to the first peak, the extreme value of this peak was slightly lower, but its subsequent impact was more lasting. The fact that China's countermeasures officially went into effect on March 10 led to another rise in public opinion on that date, creating a secondary peak. 
										The volume of news coverage declined throughout mid-to-late March, but never fell back to the level of the early days of the trade war, demonstrating the public's continued interest in the development of events and reflecting the deepening complexity and uncertainty of the trade friction.
									</p>
									<h3>Peak3</h3>
									<p>
										The third peak occurred against the backdrop of multiple rounds of tariff increases and countermeasures by the United States and China in a single day. 
										While this peak was more widely reported than the second but slightly less so than the first, it reflected the largest tariff fluctuations, with the U.S. and China announcing successive tariff increases to extremely high levels on April 9, with cumulative rates far exceeding normal tariffs, and accompanied by intensive political statements and economic responses.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, the peak of public opinion did not fully match the intensity of the event, which may indicate that the public and the media have gradually entered a stage of “information fatigue” in response to high-frequency and extreme policy adjustments, and have tended to be more rational and restrained in their response to repeated tariff escalations. 
										This phenomenon may also reflect that some media have chosen to report cautiously in the face of unpredictable escalation of confrontation, or to wait for a clearer policy direction before commenting.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is worth noting that after the peak on April 9, although the absolute number of reports did not reach an all-time high, the overall heat of public opinion was always maintained at a high level. 
										Combined with the fact that tariff policies were well beyond the realm of the reasonable at that time and were changing frequently, this suggests that the international community generally realized the gravity of the situation and began to pay sustained attention to its far-reaching implications for global supply chains, inflation levels, and bilateral relations. 
										It may also reflect the fact that the real economic impact of the multiple rounds of tariff policies was becoming apparent, thus contributing to a deeper public debate.
									</p>
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>
										To summarize, the chronological change in the number of news reports in the trade war is not only closely related to the stage-by-stage policy adjustments, but also reflects the comprehensive judgment of international public opinion on the severity of the incident, the predictability of the policy, and the future direction at different times.
